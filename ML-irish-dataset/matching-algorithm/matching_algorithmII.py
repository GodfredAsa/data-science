# Explain the detail steps for Building a model for a matching algorithm with examples
# Building a matching algorithm involves several steps, from understanding the problem and collecting data to implementing the algorithm and evaluating its effectiveness. Based on the information provided in the sources, let's create a simplified example of a matching algorithm inspired by the Roth-Peranson algorithm used in residency matching processes.

# Step 1: Understand the Problem
# The goal is to match applicants to programs based on their preferences and the preferences of the programs. No demographic or qualification information is used; instead, the focus is solely on the rank order lists submitted by applicants and programs.

# Step 2: Collect Data
# Assume we have a dataset with the following columns:

# ApplicantID
# ProgramID
# ApplicantPreference (a ranking of programs by the applicant)
# ProgramPreference (a ranking of applicants by the program)
# Step 3: Preprocess Data
# Load the dataset and preprocess it to ensure it's clean and ready for analysis.


import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('matching_data.csv')

# Drop rows with missing values
data = data.dropna()


# Step 4: Implement the Matching Algorithm
# Implement the algorithm based on the Roth-Peranson algorithm description. This involves iterating through each applicant's preference list and attempting to match them with their highest-ranked program that hasn't reached capacity. If a higher-ranked applicant is waiting, the lower-ranked applicant is moved down the list.


def matching_algorithm(data):
    # Initialize empty dictionaries to hold matches
    applicant_matches = {}
    program_matches = {}

    # Iterate through each applicant
    for index, row in data.iterrows():
        applicant_id = row['ApplicantID']
        program_id = row['ProgramID']

        # Attempt to match the applicant to their highest-ranked program
        if program_id not in program_matches and len(program_matches[program_id]) < 1:  # Assuming each program can accept 1 applicant
            applicant_matches[applicant_id] = program_id
            program_matches[program_id] = applicant_id
        else:
            # If the program is full or doesn't want the applicant, move to the next preference
            continue

    return applicant_matches, program_matches

matches = matching_algorithm(data)


# Step 5: Evaluate the Algorithm
# Evaluate the algorithm by checking if every applicant is matched to a program and vice versa. Also, assess the fairness of the matches based on the applicants' and programs' preferences.

# Check if all applicants are matched
if len(matches['applicant_matches'].keys()) == len(data['ApplicantID'].unique()):
    print("All applicants are matched.")
else:
    print("Not all applicants are matched.")

# Check if all programs are matched
if len(matches['program_matches'].keys()) == len(data['ProgramID'].unique()):
    print("All programs are matched.")
else:
    print("Not all programs are matched.")


# Why This Model Is Significant
# This model is significant because it simulates a real-world scenario where preferences play a crucial role in matching. By focusing on the preferences of both parties, the algorithm aims to optimize the outcome for everyone involved. The simplicity of the model allows for easy interpretation and modification, making it adaptable to various matching scenarios.

# Keep in mind, this is a simplified example. Real-world matching algorithms, like the Roth-Peranson algorithm used in medical residency matching, involve complex rules and considerations to ensure fairness and efficiency.
