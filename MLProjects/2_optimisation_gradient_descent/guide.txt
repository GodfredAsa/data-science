    STEPS INVOLVED IN MACHINE LEARNING AND HOW MACHINE LEARNS 
    - Many machine learning follows 3 main processes 
      - make PREDICTION (coefficients)
      - Calculate the error, thats how far from the data 
      - Learning step thats where we adjust our prediction based on the outcome we can make change to the coefficients 
      * Go back to step one to make a new prediction using the modified or new generated coefficients then step 2 again and the learn. Hence there are 3 steps 
      * The process described above for solving a problem is referred to as ALGORITHM


      COST FUNCTION: CALCULATING THE ERROR using y = mx + c, linear regression as used case. 
      RSS - Residual Some of Squares. The lower the number the better the line and estimate for coefficiences.

      The big part of machine learning is opting or optimise for a solution with the lowest cost or  for a solution with the lowest cost.
      Finding the best solution falls on Optimization

      Other names for Cost Function are Loss Function, Objective Function, Error Function
